# Search app test assignment

## Background

__MobilePay__ is a mobile payments solution which can be used to send money to your friends or buy goods from merchants. Sometimes our users need help and that is where __MobilePay Support__ steps in. But in order to help user supporters need fast and convenient way to find user between 5 million peers.

To ease life of supporters it was decided to build __MobilePay Support Tool__. Between business and IT it was agreed that building user search is a very good start. It will not only provide search functionality for supporters but also will stand as an entry point for further application navigation.

## Task

You have been assigned to develop search functionality. Our Product Owner and Tech Lead have created and epic. It was broke down into user stories which needs to be delivered by you. You will be assessed by all business/technical requirements listed in the epic, quality over delivery time is expected.

|Technical requirements: <ul><li>Existing Angular application must be extended.</li><li>Improvements of application architecture are welcome.</li><li>Angular CLI to ease scaffolding.</li><li>Backend is not ready yet. ```@search-app/data``` mimics backed.</li><li>As for now only two search results type are known. More are expected to come. Ensure Open/Close principle to show other search results.

## Project walk-through

This is a workspace created with Angular CLI version 8.2.0 with default schematics.

### Application

Application is located under ```./src/app/``` folder.
Feel free to change the structure of it to fit your best knowledged (though leaving it as it is definitely is an option, since it has it's reasons ðŸ˜Š)

### Data mock library

There is data mocks library under ```./projects/data/src/lib/data.module.ts``` . It simulates backend behavior in it's worth implementation, thus randomly 1 of 10 reads would throw an error. Read time can take up to 2 seconds.

This library's build output is linked to application via typescript path ```@search-app/data```. Thus in order for the application to run, ```@search-app/data``` has to be build first. ```npm postinstall``` does that, but in case it would fail, keep that in mind.
